 <hr />

 <h3>Ad Astra</h3>
 <p>****<br/>
Great acting by Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones with a dark story into outer
story is dark and draggy at times which earns it a 4 star rating</p>

<h3>Ford Versus Ferrari</h3>
<p>*****<br/>
Quality movie, great acting and directing, casting was exceptional. Capturing
the rocking 60's was impeccable and the cars, well...the cars....thoroughly deserves
a five star rating</p>

<h3>Rebel Moon</h3>
<p>****<br/>
Great acting and wonderful story, gets the heart racing and energy flowing, a Star Wars
movie on Adrenaline, totally a five...</p>
